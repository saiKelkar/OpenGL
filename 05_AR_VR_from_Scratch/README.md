# Real-Time AR with OpenGL and OpenCV

This project explores the integration of **OpenGL** and **OpenCV** to simulate real-time augmented reality (AR) functionality from scratch ‚Äî without relying on commercial game engines like Unity or Unreal.

The goal is to build a foundational AR pipeline that:
- Captures webcam input via OpenCV
- Renders visuals using OpenGL in real-time
- Supports overlays, filters, and (in future) mesh-based facial effects

---

## üß† Project Objectives

- Capture live video input from webcam
- Render OpenCV image frames using OpenGL
- Apply real-time effects (grayscale, edge detection, etc.)
- Lay the groundwork for real-time **facial detection and mesh overlays**

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

- **C++**
- **OpenCV** ‚Äì for webcam capture and image processing
- **OpenGL** ‚Äì for rendering
- **GLUT / GLFW / GLEW** ‚Äì window and context management
- *(Optionally: OpenGL shaders for filters)*
